# dead
A console app to see your deadlines.

# Usage
dead reads in deadlines from a CSV file. Each deadline is written on a new line like this:
```
Graphical Models, 23/11/15 12:00, Textbook questions
Research Methods, 15/01/16 23:55, Coursework 2 (Group)
```

Currently you need to have your deadlines file in the same directory as dead.py. To display your deadlines, run `python dead.py deadlines.csv`.
